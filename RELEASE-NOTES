* Thu Aug 30 2007 Akos Frohner <Akos.Frohner@cern.ch> 1.2.0-1
- using lib64 on x86_64 platform for the libraries

* Tue Jul 31 2007 David Smith <David.Smith@cern.ch> 
- improve relase of resources on error during gss_init_sec_context()
  or gss_accept_sec_context() loops and on send error in
  cgsi_plugin_send().
- Send errors are now noted and the plugin will not attempt to
  wrap and send any further data with the context.
- change peer identitiy check in client_cgsi_plugin_open()
  from an explicit check after the security context is established
  to an internal check handled by gss_init_sec_context()
- Change of behavior of CGSI_OPT_DISABLE_NAME_CHECK. Without
  the option set a client checks the server presents an
  identnity compatible with the hostname specified to
  client_cgsi_plugin_open(). (Which was the previous behavior).
  Without CGSI_OPT_DISABLE_NAME_CHECK the client does a reverse
  lookup of the server's name and uses that in the identity check.
- Added new option CGSI_OPT_ALLOW_ONLY_SELF which affects both
  client and servers and causes them to only connect/accept
  connections with peers which have the same credentials. This
  overrides CGSI_OPT_DISABLE_NAME_CHECK.
- Read/write attempts without a security context having first
  been established fail but no longer reset the error. It is
  assumed that the reason for the context establish failure has
  already been recorded, resetting the error leads to a poor
  diagnostic message.
- Small optimisation in cgsi_plugin_print_token().

* Fri Jan 19 2007 Akos FROHNER <Akos.Frohner@cern.ch> 1.1.17-2

- avoiding memory leak, if retrieve_voms_credentials() called multiple times

* Fri Jan 12 2007 Akos FROHNER <Akos.Frohner@cern.ch> 1.1.17-1

- having no VOMS extension (i.e. grid-proxy-init) is not an error

* Tue Jan  9 2007 Akos FROHNER <Akos.Frohner@cern.ch> 1.1.16-3

- enabling gSOAP 2.6.x and 2.7.x gLite builds from the same source
- maintainer has been changed to CERN/IT/GD

* Thu Aug 31 2006 Akos FROHNER <Akos.Frohner@cern.ch> 1.1.16

- VOMS parsing is no longer implicit, if CGSI_OPT_DISABLE_VOMS_CHECK
  option is used on the server side: one has to call retrieve_voms_credentials() 
  to make it happen. It returns -1 in case of error and fills the SOAP Fault 
  sturture with  the details. This fixes:
  #19355: CGSI-gSOAP shall refuse requests with invalid VOMS AC
- New server side option: CGSI_OPT_DISABLE_MAPPING, to disable gridmap-file
  lookup of the DN (for example server does its own authorization).
- Simple client-server test suite, for regression testing.
- gSOAP 2.7.x compatibility fix.
- Fixed when CGSI_TRACE was printing garbage.

* Mon Feb 13 2006 Akos FROHNER <Akos.Frohner@cern.ch> 1.1.15

- moved to the gLite build system
- moved the VOMS dependant libraries into a -voms RPM
- changed structure init to calloc that the memory is zeroad
  it fixes a segfault, if the non-voms library is used
- added interface documentation in HTML and man formats

* Thu Feb  9 2006 Ben COUTURIER <Ben.Couturier@cern.ch> 1.1.14
- Create libs for flavours gcc32dbg and gcc32dbgpthr in case of VOMS support

* Mon Jan  9 2006 Ben COUTURIER <Ben.Couturier@cern.ch> 1.1.13
- Fixed problems with VOMS code

* Mon Jan  9 2006 Ben COUTURIER <Ben.Couturier@cern.ch> 1.1.12
- Fixed memory leak in case of error in the VOMS code

* Thu Nov 17 2005 Ben COUTURIER <Ben.Couturier@cern.ch> 1.1.11
- VOMS Integration: Added new library libcgsi_plugin_voms....

* Tue Jul 12 2005 Ben COUTURIER <Ben.Couturier@cern.ch> 1.1.10
- Added license

* Fri Jul  8 2005 Ben COUTURIER <Ben.Couturier@cern.ch> 1.1.9
- Moved the plugin to /usr
- Included David Smith's activation/deactivation patch to allow 
  running the plugin in a multithreaded server
- Fixed bug in cgsi_plugin_copy (before that it was not duplicating the cgsi_plugin_data)
- Protected calls to cgsi_plugin_data->fopen and fclose
- Send error message in faultstring rather rather than in fault detail
