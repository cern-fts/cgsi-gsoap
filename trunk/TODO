Overall: feature set shall be synchronized with csec.

Problematic: currently only one VO and its attributes are returned,
    however there might be more than one VOMS AC in a proxy.

Optional: Using gridsite, instead of voms-api-c for AC parsing.

DN check: currently looks for the "host/" prefix, or else
    the check has to be disabled. Option for no prefix or
    custom prefix would be desirable.

   Minor issue in CGSI. Function gss_init_sec_context of Globus GSSAPI
   library (at least version I have installed, GT4.0.1, ver. 4.8) does not accept
   undefined target name if GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG flag is set. That was causing
   CGSI fail even before attempting handshake. Fix was simply to use
   globus_gss_assist_authorization_host_name() to generate required name.
   


Long term: Unification of gsoap-plugin and cgsi-gsoap packages.
