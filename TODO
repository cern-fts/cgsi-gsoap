Overall: feature set shall be synchronized with csec.

Problematic: currently only one VO and its attributes are returned,
    however there might be more than one VOMS AC in a proxy.

Optional: Using gridsite, instead of voms-api-c for AC parsing.

DN check: currently looks for the "host/" prefix, or else
    the check has to be disabled. Option for no prefix or
    custom prefix would be desirable.

Long term: Unification of gsoap-plugin and cgsi-gsoap packages.
